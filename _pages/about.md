This project aims to develop the mathematical foundations for a digital twin (DT) system for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), focusing on dynamic modeling, prediction, uncertainty quantification, and treatment or intervention recommendation through DT-based optimization. 
This project is supported by NSF award at the George Washington University ([NSF DMS-2436216](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2436216&HistoricalAwards=false)) and George Mason University ([NSF DMS-2436217](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2436217&HistoricalAwards=false)).

The specific goals of this project include:

- Develop computational models based on conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAE) and longitudinal CVAE to analyze brain activities, and neurodevelopmental processes.
- Create a novel bilevel formulation for fine-tuning foundational models to predict ASD outcomes.
- Develop a model-free conformal prediction procedure to ensemble predictions, integrating various types of uncertainties. 
- Develop a DT-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment plans to improve clinical outcomes.
